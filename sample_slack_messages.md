🔴 HIGH | AMP Threat
TTD Launches "Kokai" AI Campaign Automation
The Trade Desk unveiled their new AI-powered campaign
optimization layer that automatically manages bid strategies
and budget allocation across multiple channels. This directly
competes with AMP's unified optimization value proposition
and could reduce our differentiation in the market.

🟡 MEDIUM | Zero-Day Watch
Magnite Pilots "Express Pay" for Publishers
Magnite is testing accelerated payment terms of 7 days
(compared to industry standard of 60-90 days). While faster
than traditional rails, it's still not blockchain-based and
limited in scale. Not an immediate threat to Zero-Day but
worth monitoring for market validation.

🔵 OPPORTUNITY | Market Validation
Survey: 67% of Agencies Want Unified DSP Tools
New Digiday+ research reveals strong demand for cross-
platform management solutions. 67% of agencies cite "too
many disparate tools" as their top pain point. This validates
AMP's unified dashboard approach and provides strong
data for sales conversations.

🟢 LOW | General Market
Google Announces AI Updates to Performance Max
Google added natural language campaign creation to
Performance Max. Primarily focused on SMB self-serve
market, not enterprise multi-DSP use case. Limited
competitive impact to AMP's target segment.

## Channel 2: #competitor-intel-alerts
**Purpose:** HIGH priority alerts only - immediate action required

### Sample High Priority Alert 1

```
🚨 HIGH PRIORITY ALERT | AMP THREAT

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️ CRITICAL COMPETITIVE DEVELOPMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📰 **The Trade Desk Launches "Kokai" AI Platform**

**What happened:**
TTD just announced Kokai, a new AI-powered layer that sits
on top of their DSP and automatically manages campaign
optimization, bid strategies, and budget allocation across
channels. Early adopter agencies report 40% time savings.

**Why this matters:**
This is a DIRECT competitor to AMP's core value proposition:
✗ Unified cross-DSP campaign management
✗ AI-powered optimization
✗ Automated workflow and budget management

**Immediate Impact:**
• Overlaps with 70% of AMP's key selling points
• TTD's market position gives them instant credibility
• Will likely come up in Q1 sales conversations

**Recommended Actions:**
1. 🔴 URGENT: Product team competitive analysis by Wed
2. 🔴 URGENT: Sales team briefing + objection handling prep
3. 🟡 Review AMP differentiation messaging by Friday
4. 🟡 Assess if roadmap acceleration needed

### Sample High Priority Alert 2

```
🚨 HIGH PRIORITY ALERT | ZERO-DAY THREAT

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️ MAJOR COMPETITOR ANNOUNCEMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📰 **Magnite Announces "Express Pay" Full Rollout**

**What happened:**
After successful pilot, Magnite is rolling out 7-day payment
terms to all publishers starting Q2 2026. They're positioning
this as "industry-leading fast payment innovation."

**Why this matters:**
While not blockchain-based and nowhere near "zero-day,"
this directly challenges our Zero-Day Payments narrative:
⚠️ Publishers get faster payments (7d vs 60-90d standard)
⚠️ Magnite using this as competitive differentiator
⚠️ Other SSPs likely to follow suit

**Zero-Day Advantage Still Strong:**
✓ We're still 7x faster (instant vs 7 days)
✓ Blockchain transparency & security (they're still traditional)
✓ No credit risk or float financing needed

**But Market Impact:**
• Raises baseline expectations for payment speed
• Sales team needs updated competitive positioning
• Messaging needs refinement: "instant" vs "fast"

**Recommended Actions:**
1. 🔴 Update Zero-Day sales deck by Thursday
2. 🔴 Brief customer success team for renewal conversations
3. 🟡 Consider case study highlighting instant payment value
4. 🟢 Monitor if PubMatic or Index follow suit

### Sample High Priority Alert 3

```
🚨 HIGH PRIORITY ALERT | STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 MAJOR MARKET VALIDATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📰 **WPP Study: 89% of Agencies Want AI-Powered Unified Platform**

**What happened:**
WPP released their annual AdTech survey with striking data:
• 89% of agencies cite "tool consolidation" as top priority
• 76% want AI-powered cross-DSP campaign management
• 67% currently use 8+ disparate tools for campaign mgmt
• 82% would switch to consolidated solution "immediately"

**Why this matters:**
This is MASSIVE validation of AMP's entire value proposition:
✓ Confirms multi-tool pain point we're solving
✓ AI-powered automation is #1 requested feature
✓ Market timing is perfect for AMP positioning
✓ High switching intent = reduced sales friction

**Strategic Opportunity:**
This data should be EVERYWHERE:
• Sales decks (update immediately)
• Website/marketing collateral
• Investor/board materials
• PR and analyst briefings
• Customer success expansion conversations

**Recommended Actions:**
1. 🔴 URGENT: Marketing to create one-pager with key stats
2. 🔴 Sales team all-hands briefing Wednesday 2pm
3. 🔴 Update pitch deck with WPP data by end of week
4. 🟡 Consider PR pitch: "Alkimi AMP Addresses WPP Findings"
5. 🟡 Sales team outreach campaign to agencies in study

**The Timing:**
This survey gives us a MAJOR tailwind for Q1 sales. We need
to capitalize on this momentum immediately while it's fresh.
